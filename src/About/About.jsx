          I am a frontend developer with a particular interest in making things
          simple and automating daily tasks. I try to keep up with security and
          best practices, and am always looking for new things to learn. I
          choiced JavaScript as main programming langugage and I try to solve
          problems using it, but I'm definitely technology agnostic.
